This script converts an image generated by cairoxml2cairo.lua to a png file.
It requires oocairo, a cairo binding for lua.

oocairo: http://git.naquadah.org/?p=oocairo.git;a=summary

local Cairo = require "oocairo"

if #arg < 2 then
  print("usage: lua test-lua-oocairo.lua <image lua file> <png file>")
  os.exit(1)
end

local svg = dofile(arg[1])

local surface = Cairo.image_surface_create("argb32", svg.width, svg.height)
local cr = Cairo.context_create(surface)

svg.render(cr)
